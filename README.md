## 👦 About Me
I am a high school student in South Korea passionate about using programming to improve the world around me. I have developed several applications and registered patents based on my ideas, and I have actively participated in competitions to pursue these projects further. Currently, I am studying diligently in high school to broaden my insights and prepare myself for future entrepreneurship, where I aim to bring these applications to life on a larger scale.
